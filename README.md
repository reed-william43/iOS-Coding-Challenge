## About  
This app takes in data from the Dessert API in TheMealDB. The home page displays a list of dessert options, allowing the user to select one of them, linking to the details page for the dessert. When a dessert it selected, an API call is made to retrieve the ingredients and measurements of the dessert, as well as intructions below that.
